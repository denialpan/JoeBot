# JoeBot
Upcoming version of my old discord bot with more features in the future.
Currently has a functioning GUI that can run and stop the bot at will, including terminating the bot when the window is closed (not minimized). 

In other words, theres no need for the bot to run from the IDE; it can now be turned on from a standalone .jar file.

Update 8/5/20: Added perhaps the hardest thing, but the most anticipated feature I've wanted for a very long time: the ability to upload files through the bot and automatically rename and categorize images in .png format.

Why is it called JoeBot? Dunno, just an ongoing joke among my friends.
